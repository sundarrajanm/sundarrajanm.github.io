### TeamSite (CSSDK)  
**Senior Software Engineer**  
*Jul 2008 – Apr 2010*

At Autonomy Interwoven, I worked on **Interwoven TeamSite**, a leading content management system, where I owned and sustained a critical middleware SDK component — the **Content Services Software Development Kit (CSSDK)**. This SDK provided Java and SOAP-based interfaces to clients accessing content services from the TeamSite Content Management Server, built on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) in a client-server model.

This role provided me with deep experience in middleware development, enterprise integration, and automated testing frameworks, while sharpening my problem-solving skills and customer focus.

#### Key contributions:
- Quickly ramped up by learning the product, build systems, and release engineering, while contributing to issue resolution and new API development.
- Actively involved in the **Autounit framework**, driving continuous integration and automated unit testing aligned with best practices in software development.
- Proactively went beyond assigned responsibilities to troubleshoot and resolve issues across the product landscape, ensuring customer satisfaction.
- Led **feature development** for major releases — TeamSite 7.0 and 7.1 — delivering scalable and maintainable solutions.
- Spearheaded **refactoring efforts**, replacing a legacy component with an open-source server to improve system performance and maintainability.

#### Technologies used:
Core Java, SOAP, JNI, C++, Make build, Perforce, JUnit, Jenkins
