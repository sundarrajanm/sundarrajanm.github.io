### Cisco Unified Cloud Contact Centre  
**Software Engineer IV**  
*Jul 2015 – Jul 2016*

This role marked a significant turning point in my career as I transitioned from on-premise systems to cloud-native, microservices-driven architectures. Embracing new technologies rapidly and contributing to cloud-based solutions not only expanded my technical breadth but also reinforced my mindset of continuous learning — a critical attribute for scaling engineering teams and products in dynamic environments.

As a senior individual contributor to the Cloud Software Development team, I onboarded new tools, experimented with modern frameworks, and led key initiatives, setting the foundation for cloud-first approaches that are central to today’s software ecosystems.

#### Key contributions:
- Rapidly learned and applied new technologies including **Scala**, **Spray**, **Akka**, **SBT**, **AngularJS**, **ReactJS**, **NodeJS**, **Cloud Foundry**, **Redis**, and **Kafka**, and onboarded as a senior engineer contributing to cloud-native development.
- Developed a **Web-Mocking-Proxy** to simulate load environments for REST services, aiding performance testing and robustness for cloud deployments.
- Deployed to **Richardson, Texas** for a two-month assignment, delivering an **AngularJS application on the cloud**, strengthening cross-border collaboration and stakeholder engagement.
- Delivered a successful **WebRTC integration** during a hack day by enabling video/audio calls between support agents and customers via a browser-based chat widget — all hosted in the cloud.
- Received the **Clean Coder Award** for excellence in JavaScript coding, reinforcing engineering discipline in modern web frameworks.
- Provided technical leadership for the **Web UI Chat Widget (ReactJS)** and **Web Desktop**, improving user experience and interaction for the Cloud Contact Centre platform.

#### Technologies used:
Scala, Akka/Spray-based REST Microservices, SBT builds, ReactJS, Redux, Webpack, Chai, Mocha, AngularJS, Cloud Foundry, Cassandra  
Git, GitHub Enterprise, Jenkins, IntelliJ, Visual Source Editors
