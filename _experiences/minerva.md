### Senior Principal Engineer  
*Apr 2023 – Present*

At **Minerva CQ**, I’m deeply engaged in building intelligent solutions that enhance human interactions in contact centers. Our flagship **Agent Assist** product leverages domain-specific AI models to support agents in real time — blending cutting-edge technology with pragmatic engineering to solve high-value problems.

This role perfectly aligns with my growing realization that I thrive in startup-like environments where small, focused teams collaborate closely to build the right products and cultivate the right engineering culture. It’s where deep technical craftsmanship, empathy for users, and thoughtful leadership converge.

#### Major contributions:
- **AudioSink (SIP REC Server):** Prototyped and single-handedly delivered a live audio processing component that receives separate RTP streams from agents and callers, transcodes G729 to G711u/a using the open-source RTP Engine, and streams processed audio in real time. This solution replaced a costly licensed alternative, **OrecX**, significantly reducing both expenses and support overheads.
  
- **Agent Portal UX Redesign:** Led the redesign of the Agent Portal’s user interface using **Vuetify.js**, addressing scalability and usability challenges in complex workflows. By rebuilding the UI from scratch while reusing existing business logic, the new version was delivered in 5 sprints with a two-engineer team — balancing speed, consistency, and long-term maintainability.

#### Learnings & impact:
- Smaller, empowered teams foster deeper collaboration, faster iteration, and ownership — enabling engineers to innovate while staying aligned with user needs.
- Engineering leadership is about guiding teams toward building sustainable, user-centric products while reinforcing clean, scalable architecture.
- Startup environments amplify the need for technical rigor, problem-solving agility, and empathy-driven design — a space where I can contribute most effectively.

This experience confirms that my sweet spot lies in purpose-driven teams where technical leadership, thoughtful design, and strong engineering culture intersect to build products that truly serve users while enabling teams to grow and succeed.
