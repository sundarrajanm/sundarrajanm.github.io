### Mortgage Application (PENTA)  
**Software Engineer**  
*Sep 2007 – Jun 2008*

At Birlsoft, I contributed to the development of **PENTA**, a comprehensive mortgage software solution designed to streamline processes from loan origination to property discharge. The application was architected as a modular, multi-tier solution using **EJB** technologies, tailored to meet the needs of a financial services client in Australia — *La Trobe Financial Services Pty Ltd*.

This experience provided early exposure to large-scale enterprise systems, cross-border collaboration, and solution architecture — all of which helped broaden my technical and leadership capabilities.

#### Key contributions:
- Led the **off-shore development team**, coordinating deliverables and ensuring alignment with client requirements.
- Traveled to **Australia** for system prototyping and stakeholder engagement, building relationships and understanding domain-specific challenges.
- Designed **high-level system architecture**, defining module layouts that provided a solid foundation for iterative development.
- Developed core frameworks and **base layouts**, enabling subsequent feature development to proceed efficiently.
- Integrated the **GRIT Rule Engine** with PENTA, enhancing the system’s decision-making capabilities.
- Diagnosed and fixed production issues, improving stability and user experience.

#### Technologies used:
Core Java, JSP, EJB, Ant
