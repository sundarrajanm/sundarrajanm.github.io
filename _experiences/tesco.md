### Enterprise Search Service  
**Software Development Engineer II**  
*Dec 2017 – Oct 2018*

At Tesco, I contributed to the **Enterprise Search Service (ESS)**, a suite of microservices deployed on **AWS** and orchestrated using **Kubernetes**, powering the backend of Tesco’s online grocery platform. This role provided the opportunity to lead multiple services, influence engineering culture, and help teams transition toward modern technology-driven delivery practices in a large enterprise setting.

#### Major accomplishments:
- Provided **technical leadership** across **7 microservices**, guiding architectural decisions, code quality, and scalability practices within the ESS team.
- Led a **cultural transformation**, shifting the mindset of the development team from a service- and business-driven approach to one centered on technology excellence and product ownership.
- Advocated for and implemented a robust **CI/CD environment**, enabling faster, consistent, and higher-quality delivery cycles that aligned engineering processes with business goals.

#### Learnings & impact:
- Scaling microservices in cloud environments requires not only technical expertise but also cultural alignment and cross-functional collaboration.
- Driving engineering best practices at scale involves coaching teams, fostering autonomy, and embedding feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.
- Modernizing infrastructure accelerates innovation while reinforcing reliability, observability, and resilience.

This experience reinforced my belief that technology leadership is as much about empowering teams and reshaping mindsets as it is about architecture and tools — a perspective that continues to guide my approach to engineering and product development.
