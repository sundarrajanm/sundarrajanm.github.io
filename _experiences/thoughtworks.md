### Lead Consultant  
*Aug 2021 – Apr 2023*

During this tenure at ThoughtWorks, I led a team of 6–8 engineers across multiple client engagements, delivering high-impact solutions in domains ranging from retail lending to settlement services and advisory platforms. The experience reinforced the importance of quickly adapting to client needs, mentoring teams, and ensuring stable, scalable solutions under tight timelines.

#### Clients:
- **IDFC Bank** – Retail Lending  
- **Coinify** – Settlement Service  
- **McKinsey** – Price Advisor Grocery

#### Major accomplishments:
- Secured **1st prize** at a McKinsey-hosted hackathon by delivering innovative and high-quality solutions within a constrained timeframe.
- Quickly onboarded with Coinify’s platform and demonstrated **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** principles while implementing a microservice, helping align architecture with business needs.
- Took over leadership responsibilities for IDFC Bank’s retail lending platform within a short ramp-up period, ensuring continuity, stability, and seamless engagement delivery.

This experience deepened my ability to lead engineering teams through uncertainty, advocate for sound architectural practices, and build trust with clients by delivering pragmatic, scalable solutions.
