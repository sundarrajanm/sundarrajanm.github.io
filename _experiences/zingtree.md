### Senior Principal Engineer  
*Aug 2023 – Sep 2024*

This role stands out as one of the most fulfilling chapters in my career — where I was able to bring together two decades of passion, experience, and engineering rigor to transform a legacy product into a modern, scalable platform that empowered both customers and teams. The opportunity to lead from a standstill position to a fluid, continuously evolving organization, while ensuring speed, agility, and impeccable quality, made this journey deeply rewarding.

#### Major accomplishments:
- **Rendering Engine V2 Leadership:** Led the complete rewrite of Zingtree’s eight-year-old Rendering Engine — serving 600+ customers — transitioning from a legacy PHP/Bootstrap stack to a modern, AI-enhanced microservices architecture built with **Vite**, **Vue3**, **Pinia**, and **Golang**.
- **Accelerated Delivery:** Took the project from proof of concept to Alpha release within 6 months and from Alpha to full General Availability in just 3 months, enabling a seamless migration of **100% of customers** with zero friction.
- **Quality & Automation at Scale:** Instituted engineering best practices including **Test-Driven Development**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and automated testing frameworks, culminating in **1200+ unit tests** that supported multiple production releases per day.
- **Cultural Transformation:** Fostered a culture of engineering excellence by championing testing rigor, clean code practices, and continuous improvements — setting new benchmarks for development standards across the organization.

#### Learnings & impact:
- The most satisfying engineering work is one where technical craftsmanship directly translates into business continuity and customer trust.
- Building products right requires not just solving technical problems, but nurturing teams, instilling discipline, and making quality a shared responsibility.
- A modern architecture is only as good as the culture that supports it — and sustainable change happens when teams are empowered with purpose, process, and shared ownership.

This experience stands as a testament to how thoughtful engineering leadership can transform not just systems, but organizations — creating scalable, resilient solutions while empowering teams to thrive in a fast-paced, quality-driven environment.
