### Cisco Access Registrar  
**Member Technical Staff**  
*Jul 2005 – Sep 2007*

At the beginning of my professional journey, I had the opportunity to contribute to **Cisco Access Registrar**, a high-performance AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server deployed at large-scale Internet Service Providers. Working on a product that served critical infrastructure exposed me to distributed systems, performance tuning, and protocol implementations at scale — experiences that shaped my engineering discipline early on.

I was responsible for developing, owning, and sustaining key components of the server architecture, which was built in **C++** for Solaris and Linux platforms. The solution also included a lightweight **Java-based web interface** leveraging JSP, Servlets, and **JNI** for seamless interaction with native libraries. This allowed us to balance performance with usability in complex deployment environments.

#### Key contributions:
- Designed and enhanced core features such as the **backing store threading model** and **EAP protocols**, improving scalability and resilience.
- Resolved over **100 critical issues** across modules like **EAP**, **Backing Store**, **Session Manager**, **SNMP**, and **Packet Processing**, contributing to the stability of customer deployments.
- Handled **60+ customer escalations**, diagnosing issues in production environments and delivering timely resolutions.
- Participated in **onboarding, mentoring, and interviewing**, helping build a robust team culture and knowledge-sharing practices.

#### Technologies used:
C++, Core Java, JSP, Linux, Make build systems, Tomcat Web Server, JNI
