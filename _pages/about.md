**Seasoned technology leader** with **over 20 years** of experience architecting
and delivering high-impact SaaS solutions, building and **scaling engineering
teams**, and fostering engineering excellence across global organizations. A
disciplined advocate of clean coding, test-driven development, and evolutionary
architecture, I have consistently driven product innovation and operational
efficiency while enabling **cultural transformation**. My leadership spans from
bootstrapping foundational platforms using modern tech stacks to establishing
automated testing frameworks that support rapid, high-quality releases. With
a proven track record of mentoring talent, influencing engineering culture, and
**aligning technology with business strategy**, I am now focused on transitioning
into a CTO role where I can shape the next generation of software platforms and
lead teams to deliver scalable, innovative solutions with clarity and purpose.
